# QA-Fundamental Project: Design, Develop and Deploy a CRUD application
The project is to design, develop and deploy an application to test and showcase the various tools, techniques and abilities that I have gained during my short time at the academy.

The application must allow the user to CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE the various fields/sections from a front-end system, that will apply changes directly to the back-end database system.
